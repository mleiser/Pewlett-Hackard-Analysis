# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
  The purpose of this analysis was to create queries using a SQL database to determine the amount of retiring employees were job title.  It is also to determine eligibility in a mentorship program to teach new replacements.  All of this is to help determine what to do about the "silver tsunami" situation.
## Results
- There are far more Senior Staff and Senior engineers retiring based on titles than any other title combined.

- There are not enought employees eligible for the mentorship program to replace the retiring senior staff with only 1,549 eligible.
- Both of the above imply that there will be a major shortage of senior staff soon once the "silver tsunami" occurs.
- There may not be enough employees to mentor everyone due to manpower shortage.  
## Summary
Based on the analysis, there are going to be 72,458 titles that will need to be filled one the "silver tsunami" happens based on the retiring_titles database query.  There will not be enough in the mentorship program to replace everyone that's lost since each mentor would have to mentor ~70 new employees just to come close to regaining the employees.  Since there are only 1,549 eligible people, that would not be a feasable thing to do.  One query that could be good to look at for further insight is a query that shows the loss of employees when looking at departments rather than titles to determine the departments that'll be most affected.  It would also be a good idea to look at the salaries of the retiring employees to determine how much money isn't being paid to the soon-to-be retiries.
